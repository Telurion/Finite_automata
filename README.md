# Finite Automata

## Overview

This project provides a Python-based implementation of finite automata, including deterministic finite automata (DFA) and non-deterministic finite automata (NFA). It offers tools to define, manipulate, and analyze these automata, facilitating studies in formal languages and automata theory.

## Features

- **DFA and NFA Implementation**: Classes to represent and handle both deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata.
- **Automata Operations**: Functions to perform operations such as minimization, determinization, and simulation of input strings.
- **Conversion Tools**: Utilities to convert NFA to DFA and vice versa.

## Installation
